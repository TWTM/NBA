# NBA Analysis
Data Science Projects related to the NBA i've done during my time in university

NBA.ipynb contains a basic exploratory analysis from NBA players and teams

NBA_Thesis.py is the notebook that contains the code used in my thesis: 
How have NBA playersâ€™ game characteristics adapted over time to strategic changes in the use of three-point shots, and what patterns can be identified when grouping players based on offensive metrics?
